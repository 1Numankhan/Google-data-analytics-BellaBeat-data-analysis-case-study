Sršen used her background as an artist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women
around the world. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower
women with knowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and
quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.
